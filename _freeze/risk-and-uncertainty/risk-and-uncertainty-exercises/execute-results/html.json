Each outcome and the utility of that outcome is marked: wealth after losing the house when uninsured $(W-H)$, wealth after paying the insurance premium $(W-R)$, and wealth if uninsured but the house does not burn down $(W)$.\n\nThe expected utility of not purchasing insurance is on the dash-dot line between $U(W-H)$ and $U(W)$. The location of this point is determined by the probability $p$ of incurring a loss.

You will experience one of two outcomes with equal probability: \\$0 in one case and \\$200 in the other. Your average wealth in this scenario is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\$0 + \\$200}{2} = \\$100\n$$\n\nYour average utility (which is expected utility) is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{U(\\$0) + U(\\$200)}{2}\n$$\n\nWhat if you can insure (costlessly) to give you wealth of \\$100 with certainty? In that case, your average wealth is \\$100, as per the first scenario, with utility of $U(\\$100)$.\n\nDoes insurance result in higher utility?\n\nFor a risk-averse person with diminishing marginal utility, the jump from $0 to $100 provides a larger increase in utility than the jump from $100 to $200. Therefore:\n\n$$\nU(\\$100) > \\frac{U(\\$0) + U(\\$200)}{2}\n$$\n\nThe utility of average wealth is greater than the average utility of wealth.\n\nThis inequality demonstrates why people with diminishing marginal utility purchase insurance. When wealth is unevenly distributed across potential outcomes, the utility gained from the best outcome is relatively less than the utility lost from the worst outcome. Insurance helps distribute wealth more evenly across all possible outcomes. In good times, the person has slightly less wealth (due to the premium). In bad times, the person avoids a catastrophic loss. This even distribution of wealth across possible outcomes results in higher expected utility for the consumer.\n\n:::\n\n## Insurance but not a lottery ticket\n\nIn your own words but using concepts from this subject explain why a risk averse agent who makes decisions according to expected utility theory might purchase insurance but not a lottery ticket.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\nBoth lotteries and insurance have a negative expected value.\n\nThe risk averse agent will typically reject a lottery as it has a small probability of a large win for the price of a small loss. Due to diminishing marginal returns, the average weight given to each dollar in the large gain is weighted much less than the average weight given to each dollar in the small price. This makes the lottery unattractive.\n\nIn contrast, a risk averse agent may purchase insurance as for a small price they can avoid the possibility of a large loss. Due to diminishing marginal returns, the large loss can have much higher average weight given to each dollar than to the weight given to each dollar for the small premium.\n:::\n\n## An anomaly in expected utility\n\nConsider the following two choices:\n\n**Choice 1**: Choose one of the following bets:\n\nBet A:\n\n-   \\$10,000 with probability: 11%\n-   \\$0 with probability: 89%\n\nBet B:\n\n-   \\$50,000 with probability: 10%\n-   \\$0 with probability: 90%\n\n**Choice 2**: Choose one of the following bets:\n\nBet A':\n\n-   \\$10,000 with probability: 100%\n\nBet B':\n\n-   \\$50,000 with probability: 10%\n-   \\$10,000 with probability: 89%\n-   \\$0 with probability: 1%\n\nMany people pick B for Choice 1 and A' for Choice 2.\n\nDoes this pair of choices conform with Expected Utility Theory? Why?\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\nAccording to Expected Utility Theory, if an agent selects B:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\n0.10U(50,000)+0.90U(0)&> 0.11U(10,000)+ 0.89U(0) \\\\[6pt]\n0.10U(50,000)+0.01U(0)&> 0.11U(10,000)\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Expected Utility Theory, if an agent selects A':\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\nU(10,000)&>0.10U(50,000)+0.89U(10,000)+0.01U(0) \\\\[6pt]\n0.11U(10,000)&>0.89U(50,000)+0.01U(0)\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a contradiction. Under expected utility theory, if an agent chooses B it should choose B'. And if the agent chooses A it should choose A'.\n\nThis occurs due to a breach in the principle of independence.\n\nHere is a representation of the choices.\n\n![](img/allais-paradox-4.jpg)\n\nThe bets in the two shaded areas are the same. They are paired with an outcomes of either \\$10,000 or \\$0. Preferring B to A and A' to B' is a violation of the axiom of the [independence of irrelevant alternatives](@sec-independence). Under that axiom, two gambles mixed with an irrelevant third gamble will maintain the same order of preference as when the two are presented independently of the third gamble.\n\nUsing this representation in the table, here is another way of understanding why this combination of choices is an anomaly. Imagine there are 100 tickets numbered 1 to 100. One ticket will be drawn. If a ticket between 1 and 89 is drawn, you win the prize in the first column. If a ticket between 90 and 99 is drawn, you win the amount in the second. If a 100 is drawn, you win the sum in the third.\n\nSuppose that you know the ticket that is drawn is between 1 and 89. Would you prefer A or B? As you would win \\$0 with either choice, you will be indifferent. You will similarly be indifferent between A' and B', winning \\$10,00 no matter what.\n\nSuppose instead that a ticket between 90 and 100 is drawn, but you don't know which. You can see that if you prefer A to B, you should also prefer A' to B'. In each choice you are effectively facing the same bet. Let's assume for the moment that you prefer B and B'.\n\nFinally, suppose you don't know what ticket will be drawn. We have just determined that if you know the ticket is between 1 and 89 you are indifferent between the options, but if between 90 and 100 is drawn you prefer B and B'. You do not prefer A or A' when the ticket range is 1 to 89 or 90 to 100, so you should not prefer A or A' when the ticket number is unknown.\n\nFinally, using the formal definition for the independence of irrelevant alternatives axiom:\n\n-   if $x$ and $y$ are lotteries with $x\\succcurlyeq y$ and\n-   $p$ is the probability that a third option $z$ is present, then: $$\n    pz+(1-p)x\\succcurlyeq pz+(1-p)y\n    $$\n\nFor each of the choices in our lottery:\n\n-   $p=89\\%$\n\n-   $x$ is a 100% chance of \\$10,000\n\n-   $y$ is a 0.01/(1-0.89) chance of \\$0 and 0.10/(1-0.89) chance of \\$50,000\n\n-   $z$ is \\$10,000 in choice 1 and \\$0 in choice 2, although $z$'s value does not matter due to its assumed irrelevance.\n:::\n",
