A shorthand way to write this is:\n\n$$\nL=(p_1,x_1; p_2,x_2; ...; p_n,x_n)\n$$\n\nFor example, suppose you are offered a gamble with a 50% probability of winning \\$200 and a 50% probability of losing \\$100. We can write this as:\n\n$$\nL=(0.5, âˆ’100; 0.5, 200)\n$$\n\nThe order of each outcome-probability pair does not matter. I could also write:\n\n$$\nL=(0.5, 200; 0.5, -100)\n$$\n\nYou may also see gambles represented with the outcome and probability in a different order, such as:\n\n$$\nL=(x_1,p_1; x_2,p_2; ...; x_n,p_n)\n$$\n\nOr:\n\n$$\nL=(x_1,x_2,...,x_n;p_1,p_2,...,p_n)\n$$\n\nIt is typically not difficult to determine which is which.\n\n## Mathematical background\n\nWe will use some basic mathematical concepts to analyse expected utility. I will briefly review these concepts here.\n\n### Functions\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/MBALkP2bf5Y >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n:::\n\n#### Exponentiation\n\nExponentiation is a mathematical operation where a number is multiplied by itself a certain number of times.\n\nExponentiation is written as $f(x)=x^a$. That is, $x$ is multiplied by itself $a$ times. For example, $2^3=2\\times2\\times2=8$.\n\nThe exponent $a$ can be any real number, including fractions and negative numbers. For example, a plot of the function $f(x)=x^{0.5}$ is shown in @fig-square-root.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nx <- seq(0, 5, 0.1)\n\ny <- x^0.5\n\ndf <- data.frame(x, y)\n\nggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linewidth=0.25)+ \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth=0.25)+\n  labs(x = \"x\", y = \"f(x)=x^0.5\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Square root function](notation-and-mathematical-background_files/figure-html/fig-square-root-1.png){#fig-square-root width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### The exponential function\n\nThe exponential function is written as $f(x)=e^x$. The letter $e$ is a constant, approximately equal to 2.71828.

It is written as $\\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$ or $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ or $f'(x)$.\n\nThere are several simple rules to differentiate a function. The rules relevant to these notes are as follows.\n\nThe derivative of a constant is zero.\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}c=0\n$$\n\nThe derivative of an exponentiation is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}x^a=ax^{a-1}\n$$\n\nFor example:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}x^2=2x\n$$\n\nYou can see from this that for any value of $x$ greater than zero, the derivative of $x^2$ is greater than zero, signifying that the function $f(x)=x^2$ is increasing and has positive slope. For any value of $x$ less than zero, the derivative is less than zero, signifying that the function is decreasing and has negative slope.\n\nAs another example:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}x^{0.5}=0.5x^{-0.5}\n$$\n\nYou can see from this that for any value of $x$ greater than zero, the derivative of $x^{0.5}$ is greater than zero, signifying that the function $f(x)=x^{0.5}$ is increasing and has positive slope. The function is not defined for $x<0$. This is shown in @fig-square-root.\n\nThe derivative of the logarithmic function is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\ln(x)=\\frac{1}{x}\n$$\n\nThis derivative is positive for all values of $x$ for which $\\ln(x)$ is defined. Therefore $\\ln(x)$ is increasing in $x$. You can see this in @fig-logarithmic-function.\n\nThe derivative of a fraction is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{1}{f(x)}=-\\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)^2}\n$$\n\nFor example:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{1}{x}=-\\frac{1}{x^2}\n$$\n\nWhere you have a function $\\frac{1}{x^a}$, it is often easier to write it as $x^{-a}$ and use the rule for exponentiation. For example:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{d}{dx}x^{-1}=-1x^{-2}=-\\frac{1}{x^2}\n$$\n\n#### The second derivative\n\nThe second derivative of the function is a measure of the curvature of the function or the rate of change of the slope. We can calculate the second derivative by taking the derivative of the first derivative.\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x)=\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{d}{dx}f(x)\\right)\n$$\n\nWe can use the second derivative to determine whether a function is concave or convex. A function is concave if the second derivative is negative and convex if the second derivative is positive.\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x)>0 \\text{ for all } x \\Rightarrow \\text{f(x) is convex}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x)<0 \\text{ for all } x \\Rightarrow \\text{f(x) is concave}\n$$\n\nThe second derivative of a function is written as $\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x)$ or $\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2}$ or $f''(x)$.\n\nFor example, if $f(x)=x^2$, then:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}x^2=\\frac{d}{dx}2x=2\n$$\n\nThe second derivative is positive (equal to 2) for all values of $x$. This implies that $f(x)=x^2$ is increasing at an increasing rate. The function is convex.\n\nThe second derivative of $x^{0.5}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}x^{0.5}=\\frac{d}{dx}0.5x^{-0.5}=-0.25x^{-1.5}\n$$\n\nThe second derivative is negative for all values of $x$ for which $x^{0.5}$ is defined. This implies that $x^{0.5}$ is increasing at a decreasing rate. The function is concave. You can see this in @fig-square-root.\n\nThe second derivative of the logarithmic function is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\ln(x)=\\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{1}{x}=-\\frac{1}{x^2}\n$$\n\nThis second derivative is negative for all values of $x$ for which $\\ln(x)$ is defined. This implies that $\\ln(x)$ is increasing at a decreasing rate. The function is concave. You can see this in @fig-logarithmic-function.\n\nWhen working through these notes, you will not be asked to differentiate any functions. However, understanding what differentiation is and what it shows will help you understand the intuition behind the concepts I discuss. I will use the functions $f(x)=\\ln(x)$ and $f(x)=x^{0.5}$ in future sections.\n",
