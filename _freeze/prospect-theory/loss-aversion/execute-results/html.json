People feel more strongly about a loss than an equivalent gain, so they are often willing to reject gambles with a materially positive expected value.\n\nFor example, if someone feels losses with twice the feeling of gains, a 50:50 bet to win \\$550, lose \\$500 will be unattractive. This provides an alternative explanation to the absurd levels of risk aversion required to reject this bet (as discussed in @sec-absurd).\n\n## A value function with loss aversion\n\nThis equation is an example of a value function with loss aversion:\n\n$$\nv(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\nx \\space &\\textrm{where} \\space x \\geq 0\\\\\n2x \\space &\\textrm{where} \\space x<0\n\\end{matrix}\\right.\n$$\n\n$x$ is the outcome relative to the reference point.\n\nIn this value function, losses are experienced with twice the force of gains, with each loss multiplied by a factor of two.\n\nAs an example, suppose someone is given \\$100. If their initial reference point is their wealth before receiving the \\$100, $x$ will be \\$100. Therefore their change in value is +100. If the same person instead loses \\$100, their change in value would be -200.\n\nThis plot shows the increased effect of the loss under this value function:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nloss_fun <- function(x){\n  2*x\n}\ngain_fun <- function(x){\n  x\n}\n\nloss <- data.frame(\n  x=seq(-10,0,0.05),\n  y=NA\n  )\nloss$y <- loss_fun(loss$x)\n\ngain <- data.frame(\n  x=seq(0,10,0.05),\n  y=NA\n  )\ngain$y <- gain_fun(gain$x)\n\nggplot(mapping = aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_line(data = loss) +\n  geom_line(data = gain) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linewidth=0.25)+ \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth=0.25)+\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"v(X)\")+\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](loss-aversion_files/figure-html/loss-aversion-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe greater slope of the curve in the loss domain, leading to a kink where the axes intercept, is indicative of the greater effect of losses.\n\n\n## The endowment effect\n\nThe endowment effect is often used to illustrate loss aversion.\n\n@kahneman1991 ran one of the most famous and replicated experiments in economics.\n\nThey randomly assigned a free mug to members of a group and asked how much money they would accept for returning the mug (i.e. willingness to accept). The remaining participants were only shown a mug and asked about their willingness to pay for the mug.\n\n@kahneman1991 found that the willingness to accept (\\$5.75) was substantially higher than the willingness to pay (\\$2.25).\n\nThe endowment effect is this phenomenon where people impute additional value to the items they own. The endowment effect is argued to be an empirical expression of loss aversion. Willingness to accept is higher as it is payment to incur the loss of the mug.\n\nThe endowment effect has been found in real estate markets, the stock market, with basketball tickets and in other domains.\n\n### Endowment effect example\n\nBruce has the following reference-dependent value function:\n\n$$\nv(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\nx \\space &\\textrm{where} \\space x \\geq 0\\\\\n2x \\space &\\textrm{where} \\space x<0\n\\end{matrix}\\right.\n$$\n\n$x$ is the outcome relative to the reference point.\n\nAssume Bruce has preferences over money ($m$) and mugs ($c$) as in this value function:\n\n$$\nV(x)=v(m-r_m)+v(5c-5r_c)\n$$\n\n$r_m$ is Bruce's reference point as it relates to money and $r_c$ is his reference point as it relates to mugs.\n\nTo illustrate how this value function works, imagine Bruce has two mugs, and he drops one. It breaks. His change in the value function is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV(x)&=v(5c-5r_c) \\\\\n&=v(5\\times 1-5\\times 2) \\\\\n&=v(-5) \\\\\n&=-10 \\qquad(\\text{as } v(x)=2x \\text{ when } x<0)\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe loss of a mug results in value of -10.\n\nAt the beginning of the experiment, Bruce is given a mug. Assuming Bruceâ€™s reference point adapts such that he considers the mug his, how much would Bruce need to be paid to give up the mug?\n\nWe can calculate this by calculating what payment $\\$p$ would make Bruce indifferent between losing the mug and gaining $\\$p$. That is the point where, after losing the mug and receiving payment, Bruce's change in value is equal to zero.\n\nWe assume a reference point for money of his current wealth and are instructed that his reference point for mugs is ownership of the mug.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV(x)&=0 \\\\[6pt]\nV(x)&=v(m-r_m)+v(5c-5r_c) \\\\[6pt]\n&=v(W+p-W)+v(5\\times 0-5\\times 1) \\\\[6pt]\n&=v(p)+v(-5) \\\\[6pt]\n&=p-2\\times 5 \\\\[6pt]\n&=p-10 \\\\[6pt]\np&=10\n\\end{align*}\n\nBruce would need to be paid at least \\$10 to give up the mug. Giving up the mug is seen as a loss and given greater weight than the money gained.\n\nNow assume Bruce was not given a mug, but rather an opportunity to purchase a mug. How much would Bruce be willing to pay for the mug?\n\nWe can calculate this by calculating what payment \\$$p$ would make Bruce indifferent between gaining the mug and losing \\$$p$. That is the point where, after receiving the mug and making payment, Bruce's change in value is equal to zero.\n\nWe assume a reference point for money of his current wealth and are instructed that his reference point for mugs is no mug.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV(x)&=0 \\\\[6pt]\nV(x)&=v(m-r_m)+v(5c-5r_c) \\\\[6pt]\n&=v(W-p-W)+v(5\\times 1-5\\times 0) \\\\[6pt]\n&=v(-p)+v(5) \\\\[6pt]\n&=-2p+5 \\\\[6pt]\np&=2.5\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe most Bruce would be willing to pay for the mug is \\$2.50. He sees the foregone money as a loss, giving it greater weight than the mug gained.\n",
