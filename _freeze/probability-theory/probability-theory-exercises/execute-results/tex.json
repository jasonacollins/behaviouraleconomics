The following is known:\n\n-   20% of fund managers are skilled.\n\n-   If a fund manager is skilled, the probability that they outperform the market is 80%.\n\n-   If a fund manager is unskilled, the probability that they outperform the market is 40%.\n\nYou observe an outperforming fund manager. What is the probability that the fund manager is skilled?\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n\nWe calculate the solution using Bayes' rule.\n\n$$\nP(\\text{skilled}|\\text{outperform})=\\frac{P(\\text{outperform}|\\text{skilled})P(\\text{skilled})}{P(\\text{outperform})}\n$$\n\nWe can calculate $P(outperform)$ using the law of total probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{outperform})&=P(\\text{outperform}|\\text{skilled})P(\\text{skilled})+P(\\text{outperform}|\\text{unskilled})P(\\text{unskilled}) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.8\\times 0.2+0.4\\times 0.8 \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.48\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInputting this into Bayes' rule, we get:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{skilled}|\\text{outperform})&=\\frac{P(\\text{outperform}|\\text{skilled})P(\\text{skilled})}{P(\\text{outperform})} \\\\[6pt]\n&=\\frac{0.8\\times 0.2}{0.48} \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.333\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fund manager who outperforms is skilled with 0.333 probability. You cannot neglect that low base rate of skilled managers.\n:::\n\n## Detecting a terrorist\n\nEvery month 100 million people fly on commercial airlines. Imagine 10 of them are terrorists.\n\nAirport security are able to correctly identify that a person is a terrorist in 99% of cases and a non-terrorist in 99.9% of cases.\n\nA person is identified by airport security as a terrorist. Using Bayes' rule, what is the probability that they are a terrorist?\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n\nWe can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the conditional probability:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\text{terrorist | identified}) &= \\dfrac{P(\\text{identified | terrorist})P(\\text{terrorist})}{P(\\text{identified})} \\\\[12 pt]\n&= \\dfrac{0.99\\times 0.0000001}{0.99\\times 0.0000001+0.001\\times 0.999999} \\\\[12 pt]\n&= 0.000099\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOr approximately 1 in 10,000.\n:::\n\n## Rolling a die\n\nYou have two six-sided dice:\n\n-   one die is fair with the numbers 1 through to 6 occurring with equal probability\n\n-   the other die is loaded and always rolls a 5 or a 6 with equal probability.\n\nYou pull one die out of your pocket and roll it. You did not check which die it was before you rolled. (Assume you could have pulled either die out of your pocket with equal probability.)\n\na\\) The die shows a six. What is the probability that it is the loaded die?\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n\nWe are asked to calculate $P(\\text{D1 loaded}|6)$. To calculate this, I will use Bayes' rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{D1 loaded}|6)&=\\frac{P(6|\\text{D1 loaded})P(\\text{D1 loaded})}{P(6)} \\\\[12pt]\n&=\\frac{P(6|\\text{D1 loaded})P(\\text{D1 loaded})}{P(6|\\text{D1 loaded})P(\\text{D1 loaded})+P(6|\\text{D1 fair})P(\\text{D1 fair})} \\\\[12pt]\n&=\\frac{0.5\\times 0.5}{0.5\\times 0.5+\\frac{1}{6}\\times 0.5} \\\\[12pt]\n&=0.75\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first die is the loaded die with 75\\% probability.\n:::\n\nb\\) You pull the other die out of your pocket and roll it.

What is the updated probability that the first die is the loaded die?\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n\nWe are asked to calculate $P(\\text{D1 loaded}|\\text{D2 } 5)$. We have a prior probability of the first die being loaded of 0.75, which comes from the answer in the previous question.\n\nPutting this into Bayes' rule:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{D1 loaded}|\\text{D2 } 5)&=\\frac{P(\\text{D2 } 5|\\text{D1 loaded})P(\\text{D1 loaded})}{P(\\text{D2 } 5)} \\\\[12pt]\n&=\\frac{P(\\text{D2 } 5|\\text{D1 loaded})P(\\text{D1 loaded})}{P(\\text{D2 } 5|\\text{D1 loaded})P(\\text{D1 loaded})+P(\\text{D2 } 5|\\text{D1 fair})P(\\text{D1 fair})} \\\\[12pt]\n&=\\frac{\\frac{1}{6}\\times 0.75}{\\frac{1}{6}\\times 0.75+0.5\\times 0.25} \\\\[12pt]\n&=0.5\n\\end{align*}\n\nEach die is loaded with a 50\\% probability.\n\nYou could reach the same result by calculating the probability that the second die is fair given a 5. This is the same as the probability that the first die is loaded given a 5 on the second die. This approach gives the same result as the above calculation, but you need only think about one die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{D2 fair}|5)&=\\frac{P(5|\\text{D2 fair})P(\\text{D2 fair})}{P(5)} \\\\[12pt]\n&=\\frac{P(5|\\text{D2 fair})P(\\text{D2 fair})}{P(5|\\text{D2 fair})P(\\text{D2 fair})+P(5|\\text{D2 loaded})P(\\text{D2 loaded})} \\\\[12pt]\n&=\\frac{\\frac{1}{6}\\times 0.75}{\\frac{1}{6}\\times 0.75+0.5\\times 0.25} \\\\[12pt]\n&=0.5\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n## Male or female\n\nThese two related questions come from magazine columnist Marilyn vos Savant.\n\na\\) A shopkeeper says she has two new baby beagles to show you, but she doesn't know whether they're male, female, or a pair.

The defence argued both children had died of sudden infant death syndrome.

That is, the relevant probability is:\n\n$$\nP(\\text{SIDS death}|\\text{genetics, family environment, etc})\n$$\n\nThis would mean that:\n\n$$\nP(\\text{2 SIDS deaths in same family})>(P(\\text{1 SIDS death}))^2\n$$\n\nThe appropriate calculation is:\n\n$$\nP(\\text{SIDS death}\\land\\text{SIDS death})=P(1^{st}\\text{ SIDS death})\\times P(2^{nd}\\text{ SIDS death}|1^{st}\\text{ SIDS death})\n$$\n\nReason 2: We also need to consider the probability of alternative possibility - i.e. murder. We want calculate:\n\n$$\nP(\\text{murder}|{2\\text{ deaths}})=\\frac{P(2\\text{ deaths}|\\text{murder})P(\\text{murder})}{P(2\\text{ deaths})}\n$$\n\nIf murder itself is also unlikely, then it is not correct to simply attribute the alternative to SIDS the residual probability.\n:::\n\n## A fire alarm\n\nYou know the following statistics about fire:\n\n-   The probability of your house catching fire on any particular day is 1 in 10,000\n\n-   Your fire alarm correctly detects a house fire 95\\% of the time\n\n-   The probability that your fire alarm sounds on a day when there is no fire (a false alarm) is 1 in 100.\n\nYour alarm goes off.
