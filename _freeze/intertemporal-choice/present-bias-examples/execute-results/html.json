If the exponential-discounting agent selected \\$110 in two weeks for Choice 2 and was given a chance to change their choice after one week (which is effectively an offer of Choice 1), they would not change their decision.\n\n### The present-biased agent\n\nThe present biased agent has $\\delta=0.95$, $\\beta=0.95$ and utility each period of $u(x_n)=x_n$.\n\nChoice 1: Would this agent prefer \\$100 today ($t=0$) or \\$110 next week ($t=1$)? \n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$100 today is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(0,\\$100)&=u(\\$100)\\\\[6pt]\n&=100\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$110 next week is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(1,\\$110)&=u(x_0)+\\beta u(x_1) \\\\[6pt]\n&=\\beta\\delta u(\\$110) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.95\\times 0.95\\times 110 \\\\[6pt]\n&=99.275\n\\end{align*}\n        \nAs $U_0(0,\\$100) > U_0(1,\\$110)$, the present-biased agent will prefer to receive \\$100 this week.\n\nChoice 2: Would this present-biased agent prefer \\$100 next week ($t=1$) or \\$110 in two weeks ($t=2$)? \n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$100 next week is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(1,\\$100)&=u(x_0)+\\beta u(x_1)+\\beta\\delta^2 u(x_2) \\\\[6pt] \n&=\\beta\\delta u(\\$100) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.95\\times 0.95\\times 100 \\\\[6pt]\n&=90.25\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$110 in two weeks is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(2,\\$110)&=u(x_0)+\\beta u(x_1)+\\beta\\delta^2 u(x_2) \\\\[6pt]\n&=\\beta\\delta^2 u(\\$110) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.95\\times 0.95^2\\times 110 \\\\[6pt]\n&=94.31\n\\end{align*}\n\nAs $U_0(1,\\$100)=90.25<94.31=U_0(2,\\$110)$, the present-biased agent will prefer to receive \\$110 in two weeks.\n\nIf we consider those two choices by the present-biased agent together, we see the following pattern.\n\nFor choice 1, the present-biased agent will prefer \\$100 now to \\$110 in one week. Their preference for benefits now due to the short-term discount factor $\\beta$ leads them to prefer the immediate payoff.\n\nFor choice 2, the present-biased agent will prefer \\$110 in two weeks to \\$100 in one week. They are willing to wait longer for a larger reward, with both outcomes in the future and subject to the short-term discount factor $\\beta$.\n\nConsider what would happen if this present-biased agent selected the \\$110 in two weeks in Choice 2, but after one week we asked if they would like to reconsider their choice. They are effectively being offered Choice 1. This would then lead them to change their mind and take the immediate \\$100.\n\nThis combination of decisions is time inconsistent. The present-biased agentâ€™s actions are not consistent with their initial plan.\n\nWe can see this change in preference in the following diagram.\n\nThe vertical bars represent the payments of \\$100 and \\$110. The lines projecting back from the bars to the y-axis represent the discounted utility of each payment at each time.\n\nThere is a kink in the line projecting from the \\$110 in two weeks, representing the effect of the short-term discount factor $\\beta$. Between $t=1$ and $t=2$ both the short-term and usual discount factors are applied. This leads to that part of the curve having a steeper slope than between $t=0$ and $t=1$ where only the usual discount factor is applied.\n\nAt $t=0$ the discounted utility of the \\$110 at $t=2$ is higher and that payment is therefore preferred. At $t=1$ when the \\$100 is no longer discounted by the short-term discount factor $\\beta$, it suddenly becomes more attractive. If offered on that day, would be chosen in substitute of the \\$110 due in another week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a function to create the discounted bar chart\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Helper function to create discounted values\ncreate_discount_data <- function(value, t, beta, delta, start) {\n  times <- seq(start, t, by = 1)\n  data.frame(\n    t = times,\n    group = as.character(t),\n    value = ifelse(t==times, value, value * beta * delta^(t - times))\n  )\n}\n\n# Main function to create the discounted bar chart\ncreate_discounted_bar_chart <- function(smaller, t_s, larger, t_l, beta, delta, starting_at = 0, y_spacing = 20, x_spacing = 1) {\n  # Create the data\n  data <- data.frame(\n    t = c(t_s, t_l),\n    U_t = c(smaller, larger)\n  )\n  \n  # Create the discounted values, starting from 'starting_at'\n  discounted_data <- rbind(\n    create_discount_data(smaller, t_s, beta, delta, starting_at),\n    create_discount_data(larger, t_l, beta, delta, starting_at)\n  )\n  \n  # Shift t values based on starting_at\n  data$t_plot <- data$t - starting_at\n  discounted_data$t_plot <- discounted_data$t - starting_at\n  \n  # Filter out any data points before the starting point\n  data <- data[data$t >= starting_at, ]\n  discounted_data <- discounted_data[discounted_data$t >= starting_at, ]\n  \n  # Determine x-axis and y-axis limits\n  x_min <- 0\n  x_max <- max(max(data$t_plot), max(discounted_data$t_plot))\n  y_max <- max(max(data$U_t), max(discounted_data$value)) * 1.1  # 10% buffer\n  \n  # Create the plot\n  ggplot() +\n    # Add the bars\n    geom_rect(data = data, aes(xmin = ifelse(t_plot == 0, 0, t_plot - 0.15),\n                               xmax = ifelse(t_plot == 0, 0.15, t_plot + 0.15),\n                               ymin = 0, ymax = U_t),\n              fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n    \n    # Add the discount lines\n    geom_line(data = discounted_data, aes(x = t_plot, y = value, group = group, linetype = group), \n              color = \"black\", linewidth = 1) +\n    \n    # Customize the plot\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(x_min, x_max + 1, by = x_spacing), \n                       limits = c(x_min, x_max + 1),\n                       expand = c(0, 0),\n                       labels = function(x) x + starting_at) +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, y_max, by = y_spacing), \n                       limits = c(0, y_max),\n                       expand = c(0, 0)) +\n    geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linewidth = 0.25) + \n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth = 0.25) +\n    labs(x = \"t\",\n         y = expression(U[t])) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n      axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5),\n      panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n      legend.position = \"none\"\n    )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncreate_discounted_bar_chart(100, 1, 110, 2, 0.95, 0.95)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![\\$100 next week or \\$110 in two weeks?](present-bias-examples_files/figure-html/fig-present-bias-example-1-1.png){#fig-present-bias-example-1 width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## A longer delay\n\nAssume there is a present-biased agent with $\\beta=0.75$, $\\delta=0.9$ and utility each period of $u(x_n)=x_n$.\n\nWould this agent prefer \\$10 in five days ($t=5$) or \\$20 in 10 days ($t=10$)? \n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$10 in five days is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(5,\\$10)&=\\beta\\delta^5u(\\$10) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.75\\times 0.9^5\\times 10 \\\\[6pt]\n&=4.43\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$20 in 10 days is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(10,\\$20)&=\\beta\\delta^{10} u(\\$20) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.75\\times 0.9^{10}\\times 20 \\\\[6pt]\n&=5.23\n\\end{align*}\n\nAs $U_0(5,\\$10)=4.43<5.23=U_0(10,\\$20)$, this present-biased agent will prefer to receive \\$20 in 10 days.\n\nFive days pass so we are now at $t=5$.

However, at $t=7$, the discounted utility of \\$100 at $t=7$ is higher than the discounted utility of \\$200 at $t=14$.
