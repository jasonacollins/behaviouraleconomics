She is offered two choices.\n\nChoice 1: Would she prefer \\$100 today ($t=0$) or \\$110 next week ($t=1$)?\n\nTo determine this, we calculate the discounted utility of each option. Alison will prefer the option with the highest discounted utility.\n\nWe write the discounted utility of the \\$100 today as $U_0(0,\\$100)$. The subscript 0 indicates that the utility is calculated at time $t=0$. The first number in the brackets indicates the time the payment is received. In this case, the \\$100 is received at $t=0$, today. The second number in the brackets is the value of the payment.\n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$100 today, $U_0(0,\\$100)$, is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(0,\\$100)&=u(\\$100) \\\\[6pt]\n&=100\n\\end{align*}\n\nThere is no discount $\\delta$ applied to the \\$100 as it is received immediately.\n\nWe write the discounted utility of the \\$110 next week as $U_0(1,\\$110)$. The subscript 0 again indicates that the utility is calculated at time $t=0$. The first number in the brackets, 1, indicates the time the payment is received, $t=1$. The second number in the brackets is the value of the payment.\n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$110 next week is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(1,\\$110)&=\\delta u(\\$110) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.95\\times 110 \\\\[6pt]\n&=104.5\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn this case, a discount of $\\delta=0.95$ is applied to the \\$110 as it is received in one week.\n\nWe can now compare the discounted utility of each option. $U_0(0,\\$100)=100<104.5=U_0(1,\\$110)$. Alison would prefer to receive \\$110 next week as it leads to higher discounted utility.\n\n@fig-alison-choice-1 visualises the effect of discounting in Choice 1.\n\nThe two bars represent the options: \\$100 at $t=0$ and \\$110 at $t=1$. The line from the \\$110 option represents the discounted utility of that option at each time. At $t=0$ the discounted utility of the \\$110 received at $t=1$ is 104.5. At $t=0$ we can see that the \\$110 is preferred as the line indicating discounted utility is higher than the utility of the \\$100 received immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Alison's consideration of Choice 1](exponential-discounting-examples_files/figure-pdf/fig-alison-choice-1-1.png){#fig-alison-choice-1}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoice 2: Would Alison prefer \\$100 next week ($t=1$) or \\$110 in two weeks ($t=2$)?\n\nAgain, we calculate the discounted utility of each option. Alison will prefer the option with the highest discounted utility.\n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$100 next week is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(1,\\$100)&=\\delta u(\\$100) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.95\\times 100 \\\\[6pt]\n&=95\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$110 in two weeks is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(2,\\$110)&=\\delta^2 u(\\$110) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.95^2\\times 110 \\\\[6pt]\n&=99.275\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe can now compare the discounted utility of each option. $U_0(1,\\$100)=95<99.275=U_0(2,\\$110)$. Alison would prefer to receive \\$110 in two weeks.\n\nThe set of decisions across Choice 1 and Choice 2 are time consistent. If Alison selected \\$110 in two weeks for Choice 2 and was given a chance to change her choice after one week (which is effectively Choice 1), she would not change her decision.\n\n@fig-alison-choice-2 visualises the effect of discounting in Choice 2.\n\nThe two bars represent the options: \\$100 at $t=1$ and \\$110 at $t=2$. The line from each represents the discounted utility of that option at each time.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Alison's consideration of Choice 2](exponential-discounting-examples_files/figure-pdf/fig-alison-choice-2-1.png){#fig-alison-choice-2}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, at $t=1$ the discounted utility of the \\$100 received at $t=1$ is 100 and the discounted utility of the \\$110 received at $t=2$ is 104.50. We can read those values from the line. For any time $t$ we can determine which option would be preferred by seeing which line is higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Alison's consideration of Choice 2 - discounted utilities](exponential-discounting-examples_files/figure-pdf/fig-alison-choice-2-discount-1.png){#fig-alison-choice-2-discount}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will note that the two lines do not cross. For an exponential discounter, if one line is higher at any particular time $t$, it is higher at all times.\n\n@fig-alison-choice-2-reconsidered visualises Choice 2 reconsidered at $t=1$, which as noted earlier, is effectively Choice 1. The discounted utility of the \\$100 received immediately is less than the discounted utility of \\$110 in one week. The preference for the higher-value option remains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Alison's reconsideration of Choice 2](exponential-discounting-examples_files/figure-pdf/fig-alison-choice-2-reconsidered-1.png){#fig-alison-choice-2-reconsidered}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Example 2: How much for a one-year delay?\n\nBrenda is an exponential discounter with discount factor $\\delta=0.95$ per week and utility each period of $u(x_n)=x_n$\n\nShe is offered \\$100 today. What sum would she need to be offered in one year (52 weeks) to prefer that later payment to the \\$100 today?\n\nTo determine this, we calculate what sum received in one year would give Brenda the same discounted utility as receiving \\$100 today.\n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$100 today is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(0,\\$100)&=u(\\$100) \\\\[6pt]\n&=100\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe discounted utility of the sum $y$ received in 52 weeks is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(52,\\$y)&=\\delta^{52} u(\\$y) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.95^{52}\\times y\n\\end{align*}\n\nAs there is a 52-period delay, the discount factor $\\delta$ is applied 52 times.\n\nShe will prefer \\$$y$ in 52 weeks if $U(52,\\$y)$ is greater than 100.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(52,\\$y)&>100 \\\\[6pt]\n0.95^{52}\\times y&>100 \\\\[6pt]\ny&>\\frac{100}{0.95^{52}} \\\\[6pt]\ny&>\\$1440.03\n\\end{align*}\n\nBrenda would be willing to wait a year for payment if she was paid more than $1440.03.\n\n@fig-brenda visualises this problem. The bar at $t=52$ represents the \\$1440.03 Brenda would need to be paid (at minimum) to prefer that payment to \\$100 today. The line extended from that bar back to $t=0$ indicates the discounted utility of that payment at any time $t$. At $t=0$ the discounted utility of the \\$1440.03 is equal to the utility of \\$100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Brenda's choice](exponential-discounting-examples_files/figure-pdf/fig-brenda-1.png){#fig-brenda}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Example 3: \\$10 in five days or \\$20 in 10 days?\n\nChelsea is an exponential discounter with discount factor $\\delta=0.75$ and utility each period of $u(x_n)=x_n$.\n\nWould Chelsea prefer \\$10 in five days ($t=5$) or \\$20 in 10 days ($t=10$)? \n\nWe calculate the discounted utility of each option. Chelsea will prefer the option with the highest discounted utility.\n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$10 in five days is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(5,\\$10)&=\\delta^5u(\\$10) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.75^5\\times 10 \\\\[6pt]\n&=2.37\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe discount factor $\\delta$ is applied five times as the payment is received in five days.\n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$20 in 10 days is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(10,\\$20)&=\\delta^{10} u(\\$20) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.75^{10}\\times 20 \\\\[6pt]\n&=1.13\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe discount factor $\\delta$ is applied 10 times as the payment is received in 10 days.\n\nWe can now compare the discounted utility of each option. $U_0(5,\\$10)=2.37>1.13=U_0(10,\\$20)$. The discounted utility is higher for the \\$10 in five days. As a result, Chelsea will prefer to receive \\$10 in five days.\n\nDorothy is an exponential discounter with discount factor $\\delta=0.95$ and utility each period of $u(x_n)=x_n$. Dorothy has a larger discount factor than Chelsea, meaning that she applies a smaller discount to future outcomes.\n\nWould Dorothy prefer \\$10 in five days ($t=5$) or \\$20 in 10 days ($t=10$)? \n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$10 in five days is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(5,\\$10)&=\\delta^5u(\\$10) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.95^5\\times 10 \\\\[6pt]\n&=7.74\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe discounted utility of the \\$20 in 10 days is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(10,\\$20)&=\\delta^{10} u(\\$20) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.95^{10}\\times 20 \\\\[6pt]\n&=11.97\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe discounted utility is higher for the \\$20 in 10 days. Dorothy will prefer to receive \\$20 in 10 days.\n\n@fig-example3 visualises the choices and Chelsea and Dorothy's discounting of the payoffs.\n\nIn both charts, vertical bars represent the \\$10 in five days and \\$20 in 10 days. The lines projecting back to $t=0$ represent the discounted utility of those payoffs at each time.\n\nWhen $\\delta=0.75$, the heavy discount to the more distant payoff means that it has a lower discounted utility than the smaller, sooner payment of \\$10. When $\\delta=0.95$, the discount is less severe and the \\$20 in 10 days has a higher discounted utility than the \\$10 in five days.\n\n::: {#fig-example3 layout-ncol=2}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Chelsea's choice ($\\delta=0.75$)](exponential-discounting-examples_files/figure-pdf/fig-chelsea-1.png){#fig-chelsea}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Dorothy's choice ($\\delta=0.95$)](exponential-discounting-examples_files/figure-pdf/fig-dorothy-1.png){#fig-dorothy}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExponential discounting\n:::\n",
