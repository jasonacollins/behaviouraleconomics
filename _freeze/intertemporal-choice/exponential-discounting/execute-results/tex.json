The discount factor $\\delta$ is a number between 0 and 1. The higher the discount factor, the less the agent discounts future costs and benefits.\n\nYou will often see discussion of the ”discount rate”, $r$. In discrete time, the relationship between $\\delta$ and $r$ is as follows:\n\n$$\\delta=\\frac{1}{1+r}$$\n\nA larger discount factor implies less discounting. A larger discount rate implies more discounting.\n\nUnder the standard model of exponential discounting, an agent with a choice between alternative streams of payoffs will seek to maximize the discounted utility of the future path of consumption.\n\nThe following equation is an example of exponential discounting, with a stream of costs or benefits $x_0$ through to $x_T$ incurred at periods 0 through to $T$. $U_0$ is utility of the stream of payoffs at time $t=0$. $x_t$ is the payoff in period $t$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0&=u(x_0)+\\delta u(x_1)+\\delta^2u(x_2)+\\delta^3u(x_3)+...+\\delta^Tu(x_T) \\\\[6pt]\n&=\\sum_{t=0}^{t=T}\\delta^tu(x_t) \\\\[12pt]\n0&\\leq \\delta\\leq1\n\\end{align*}\n\nEach period of delay results in a discount of the future cost or benefit by a factor of $\\delta$. One period of delay results in a discount of $\\delta$. Two periods of delay results in a discount of $\\delta^2$. Three periods of delay results in a discount of $\\delta^3$ and so on.\n\nThe degree of discounting in this equation evolves each period as 1, $\\delta$, $\\delta^2$, $\\delta^3$, $\\delta^4$ and so on. This results in a smooth decline in present value of a future payoff over time.\n\n## Visualising exponential discounting\n\n@fig-exponential illustrates the effect of exponential discounting. The figure plots the size of the discount as a function of $t$ for an exponential discounter with $\\delta=0.9$ and $\\delta=0.75$.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Exponential discount curves](exponential-discounting_files/figure-pdf/fig-exponential-1.png){#fig-exponential}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Time-consistency\n\nOne implication of exponential discounting is time consistency.\n\nOnce the agent starts moving along the consumption path, they are time-consistent with their initial plan. For example, consider an agent facing the following two choices:\n\nWould you like \\$100 today or \\$110 next week?\n\nWould you like \\$100 next week or \\$110 in two weeks?\n\nAn exponential discounter will choose \\$100 in both choices or \\$110 in both choices. The reason is that after one week the second choice effectively becomes the same as the first choice. Time consistency implies that they will continue to want to make the same choice regardless of when they are making it.\n\n## Exponential discounted utility model assumptions\n\nThe standard model of exponential discounting is underpinned by several assumptions.\n\n### Consumption independence\n\nThe first assumption is consumption independence.\n\nConsumption independence means that utility in period $t+k$ is independent of consumption in any other period. An outcome’s utility is unaffected by outcomes in prior or future periods.\n\nImagine a world where an exponential discounter intends to consume a behavioural economics subject.\n\nSuppose that exponential discounter wants to consume lecture 1 at $t+3$ and lecture 2 at $t+4$. Under consumption independence, if the agent does not attend lecture 1, they still expect to benefit from lecture 2 at $t+4$ consistent with the plan they decided at $t$.\n\nThis assumption allows us to write $x=x_1+x_2+x_3+...+x_n$. That is, good $x$ can be split, allocated and moved across periods without changing the value of that good beyond the effect of the discount.\n\n### Stationary preferences\n\nA second assumption is stationary preferences.\n\nThat is, $U_t=U_{t=K}$.\n\nThe utility function is stationary across periods. The functional form of $U_t$ is the same as the functional form of $U_{t+k}$.\n\nThat means that if someone likes ice cream today, they will get the same utility from ice cream at a future time of consumption. Any preference for ice cream today versus tomorrow comes from the discounting of future consumption, not from changes in taste.\n\nSimilarly, with stationary preferences, you would not learn to appreciate the taste of wine over time.\n\n### Utility independence\n\nA third assumption is utility independence.\n\nUnder utility independence, all that matters is maximizing the sum of discounted utilities. Decision makers have no preference for the distribution of utilities. They don't seek to delay gratification or get unpleasant things out of the way.\n",
