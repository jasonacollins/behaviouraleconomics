Indicate the certainty equivalent of option A. Explain how the graph shows which option Simon will choose.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n\nThis chart shows the choices faced by Simon, his utility curve and the expected utility of each option. The horizontal axis is the outcome and the vertical axis is utility of each outcome. The utility curve is the function $U(x)=x^{0.5}$.\n\nThe two possible outcomes of gamble A are W-100=100 and W-20=180, which deliver $U(W-100)$ and $U(W-20)$ respectively. Each are labelled on the chart.\n\nThe expected utility of gamble A is the weighted average of these two utilities and lies on the straight line between $U(W-100)$ and $U(W-20)$. As each outcome has a 50% chance of occurring, the expected utility of gamble A is the midpoint of this line (as is the expected value of the gamble). The vertical line from $W+E[A]=140$ identifies that point, with the expected utility $E[U(A)]$ marked on the vertical axis.\n\nThe certain outcome from option B, the loss of \\$30 resulting in wealth of \\$170 is also marked on the x-axis, leading to utility of $U(W-B)$.\n\nIt can be seen that the expected utility of gamble A, $E[U(A)]$, is less than the utility of the certain outcome $U(W-B)$. Simon will therefore choose B.\n\nThe certainty equivalent of option A is identified as the point where $U(CE)=E[U(A)]$. This is identified by drawing a horizontal line from the expected utility of gamble A to the utility curve. The point where this line intersects the utility curve is the certainty equivalent of gamble A, shown by projecting a vertical line downward.\n\nThis diagram is not drawn to scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Simon's consideration of option A and B](expected-utility-theory-problems_files/figure-pdf/simon-chart-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n## Starting a business\n\n\\(a) Stacey, an expected utility maximiser, was considering quitting her job to start a new business. She calculated that her business proposal had a positive expected value but that there is a material risk of a loss. She decided not to start the business.\n\nUse concepts from expected utility theory to explain why Stacey may have decided not to start the business.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n\nStacey may have decided not to pursue the business opportunity as she is risk averse. Someone who is risk averse will value the expected value of a gamble less than the equivalent amount paid with certainty. This means that a positive value bet might be turned down.\n\n:::\n\n\\(b) Use a graph to demonstrate your answer to part (a).\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n\nThis graph shows Stavey's utility curve. As she is risk averse, the curve is concave (at least over the domain of the decisions we are considering).\n\nSuppose there are two possible outcomes from starting the business. a moderate loss and a large gain, each having equal probability. Each of the outcomes of the business are labelled. Stacey finishes with his wealth minus the business loss ($W-L$) or her wealth plus the business gains ($W+G$). If she does not start the business, her wealth remains at $W$. The utility of each possible outcome ($U(W-L)$, $U(W)$, $U(W+G)$) is also indicated on the vertical axis.\n\nThe expected value of starting the business is labelled ($E[X]$). As the business has positive expected value, $E[X]$ is greater than $W$.\n\nThe expected utility of the business lies on the straight line between the utility of the two possible business outcomes. The place on the line is determined by the probability of winning and is in line with the expected value of the business. We can identify the expected utility of the business by projecting a line up from $E[X]$ to the straight line.\n\nFinally, the certainty equivalent of the business is also marked. As $U(CE)=E[U(X)]$, we can identify the certainty equivalent by projecting a line up from $E[U(X)]$ to the utility curve.\n\nDue to the convex curve, we can see that $E[U(X)]$ is less than $U(W)$. Stacey prefers the certain outcome of $W$ to starting the business. Alternatively, we can see that the certainty equivalent of the business is lower than current wealth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](expected-utility-theory-problems_files/figure-pdf/stacey-chart-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\\(c) Later, Stacey received a large inheritance from her Aunt. She then decided to quit work and go ahead with her business plan.\n\nUse concepts from expected utility theory to explain why Stacey may have changed her mind.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Answer\n\nThat Stacey later decided to pursue the business opportunity is likely because she is more risk neutral (or possibly even risk seeking) at higher wealth. The result is that the positive expected value gamble is more likely to be accepted at the higher wealth level.\n\nOne mechanism by which this could occur is the utility function becomes increasingly linear with higher wealth (as is the case with $u(x)=\\ln(x)$ or $u(x)=x^{0.5}$).\n\n:::\n\n## Risk neutrality versus risk aversion\n\nAnika and Anthony are offered a choice between options A and B:\n\nA: Lottery $A=(0.5, \\$100; 0.5, \\$20)$.

Indicate the certainty equivalent of option A.

The horizontal axis is the outcome and the vertical axis is utility of each outcome. The utility curve is the function $U(x)=\\text{ln}(x)$.\n\nThe two possible outcomes of gamble A are W+20=120 and W+100=200, which deliver $U(W+20)$ and $U(W+100)$ respectively. Each are labelled on the chart.\n\nThe expected utility of gamble A is the weighted average of these two utilities and lies on the straight line between $U(W+20)$ and $U(W+100)$. As each outcome has a 50% chance of occurring, the expected utility of gamble A is the midpoint of this line (as is the expected value of the gamble). The vertical line from $W+E[A]=160$ identifies that point, with the expected utility $E[U(A)]$ marked on the vertical axis.\n\nThe certain outcome from option B, the receipt of \\$40 resulting in wealth of \\$140 is also marked on the x-axis, leading to utility of $U(W+B)$.\n\nIt can be seen that the expected utility of gamble A $E[U(A)]$ is greater than the utility of the certain outcome $U(W+B)$. Anthony will therefore choose gamble A.\n\nThe certainty equivalent of option A is identified as the point where $U(CE)=E[U(A)]$.

As he is risk seeking it is convex (at least over the domain of the lottery).\n\nEach of the outcomes of the lottery are labelled. Andrew finishes with his wealth minus the cost of the lottery ticket ($W-T$) or his wealth minus the cost of the lottery ticket plus his lottery winnings ($W-T+L$). If he does not purchase the ticket, his wealth remains at $W$. The utility of each possible outcome ($U(W-T)$, $U(W)$, $U(W-T+L)$) is also indicated on the vertical axis.\n\nThe expected value of the lottery after buying the ticket is labelled ($E[X]$). As the lottery has a negative expected value, $E[X]$ is less than $W$.\n\nThe expected utility of the lottery lies on the straight line between the utility of the two possible lottery outcomes. The place on the line is determined by the probability of winning and is in line with the expected value of the lottery. We can identify the expected utility of the lottery by projecting a line up from $E[X]$ to the straight line.\n\nFinally, the certainty equivalent of the lottery is also marked.

Andrew prefers the lottery to the certain outcome of $W$. Alternatively, we can see that the certainty equivalent of the lottery is higher than current wealth.
