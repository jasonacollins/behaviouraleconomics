An agent would pick the option that maximises their expected utility.\n\n## Calculating expected utility\n\nConsider a prospect with final outcomes $x_1, ..., x_n$, with each outcome occurring with probability $p_1, ..., p_n$. Each outcome would deliver utility $U(x_i)$.\n\n$$\nX=(p_1, x_1;\\ p_2, x_2; ...\\ ;\\ p_n, x_n)\n$$\n\nFor example, the prospect might be a coin flip that delivers a win of \\$10 for heads and a loss of \\$10 for tails. We would represent this prospect as:\n\n$$\nX=(0.5, \\$10;\\ 0.5, -\\$10)\n$$\n\nExpected utility, $E[U(X)]$, is calculated using the following formula:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nE[U(X)]&=p_1U(x_1)+p_2U(x_2)+ ... +p_nU(x_n) \\\\[6pt]\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^n p_iU(x_i)\n\\end{align*}\n\nYou can think of this formula as comprising the following steps:\n\n1. Define utility $U(x_i)$ over final outcomes $x_1, ..., x_n$\n\n2. Weight the utility of each outcome $U(x_i)$ by the probability $p_i$ of outcome $x_i$\n\n3. Add the weighted utilities.\n\nFor the coin toss that delivers a win or loss of $10, we would write:\n\n$$\nE[U(X)]=0.5\\times U(\\$10)+0.5\\times U(-\\$10)\n$$\n\nThere is an important note regarding outcomes $x_1, ..., x_n$. Typically, these outcomes are not just the payoffs from the gamble, but rather the agent's final position. If the agent has wealth of \\$100 and is offered a coin flip to win or lose \\$10, the outcomes are typically taken to be \\$90 and \\$110. Their decision depends on their current wealth. As a result, expected utility is often represented as in this equation:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nE[U(W+X)]&=p_1U(W+x_1)+p_2U(W+x_2)  \\\\[6pt]\n&\\qquad +...+p_nU(W+x_n) \\\\[6pt]\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^n p_iU(W+x_i)\n\\end{align*}\n\nReturning to our coin toss example, if our starting wealth was \\$100, the expected utility of the coin toss is:\n\n$$\nE[U(X)]=0.5\\times U(\\$110)+0.5\\times U(\\$90)\n$$\n\n## Attitudes toward risk\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/ubJB8A6KlNE >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n:::\n\n\nExpected utility theory allows us to examine an agent's attitude toward risk.\n\nThere are three possible attitudes toward risk: risk aversion, risk neutrality, and risk seeking.\n\nIf a person prefers a sure amount to a gamble with the same expected value, they are risk averse. That is, the utility of the expected value of $X$ is greater than the expected utility of $X$.\n\n$$\nU(E[X])>E[U(X)]\n$$\n\nIf a person prefers a gamble to a sure amount of the same expected value, they are risk-seeking. That is, the expected utility of $X$ is greater than the utility of the expected value of $X$.\n\n$$\nU(E[X])<E[U(X)]\n$$\n\nIf a person is indifferent between a gamble and receiving the expected value of the gamble with certainty, they are risk neutral. That is. the utility of the expected value of $X$ is equal to the expected utility of $X$.\n\n$$\nU(E[X])=E[U(X)]\n$$\n\n### Certainty equivalent\n\nOne useful concept in the analysis of attitudes to risk is the certainty equivalent. The certainty equivalent (CE) of a gamble X is the amount of money such that you are indifferent between taking the gamble and taking the money. That is, the utility of the certainty equivalent is equal to the expected utility of the gamble.\n\n$$\nu(CE)=E[U(X)]\n$$\n\nFor a risk-averse person, the certainty equivalent of the bet is less than the expected value of the gamble. The certainty equivalent is equal to the expected value in the case of risk neutrality. A risk-seeking person would have a certainty equivalent higher than the expected value of the gamble.\n\nI will now look at each of the attitudes in turn.\n\n### Risk aversion\n\nA risk-averse person prefers a sure amount to a gamble with the same expected value. If I strongly prefer \\$10 for certain to a gamble with an expected value of \\$10, I am risk averse. The certainty equivalent of the prospect for this person would be less than \\$10.\n\nThe following chart illustrates. The x-axis is the amount of the good over which the person receives utility. In the case of monetary gambles of the type we are talking about, the x-axis is the amount of money. The y-axis is the utility the person receives from that money.\n\nThe utility curve is a plot of the utility function for each amount of money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nu <- function(x){\n  log(x)\n}\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x=seq(1,220,0.1),\n  y=NA\n)\n\ndf$y <- u(df$x)\n\n#Variables for plot (may not match labels as not done to scale)\n#Payoffs from gamble\np1 <- 0.5\nx1 <- 30 #loss\np2 <- 0.5\nx2 <- 200 #win\nev <- p1*x1+p2*x2 #expected value of gamble\nxc <-115 #certain outcome\nce <-exp(p1*u(x1)+p2*u(x2)) #certainty equivalent\npx2 <-(ev-x1)/(x2-x1)\n\nrisk_aversion_plot_1 <- ggplot(mapping = aes(x, y)) +\n\n  #Plot the utility curve\n  geom_line(data = df) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linewidth=0.25)+ \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth=0.25)+\n  labs(x = \"x\", y = \"U(x)\")+\n\n  # Set the theme\n  theme_minimal()+\n\n  #remove numbers on each axis\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n            axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n            axis.title=element_text(size=14,face=\"bold\"),\n            axis.title.y = element_text(angle=0, vjust=0.5))+\n\n  #set limits - need to include room for labels\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-25, 220), ylim = c(-0.1, 6))\n\nrisk_aversion_plot_1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Risk aversion 1](expected-utility-theory_files/figure-html/fig-risk-aversion-1-1.png){#fig-risk-aversion-1 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gamble shown in this chart has two possible outcomes, $x_1$ and $x_2$.

They both lie the same horizontal distance between the two potential outcomes.\n\nIn this example, the line between the utility of the two outcomes is always below the utility curve. That is, for any probabilities involving those two outcomes (except one of those outcomes with certainty), the expected utility of the prospect is less than the utility of the expected value of the prospect. In mathematical terms:\n\n$$\nU(E[x])>E[U(x)]\n$$\n\nThe expected utility line between the two outcomes is always below the utility curve as the curve is concave. A concave curve leads to risk aversion. The greater the curvature, the more risk averse the agent is.\n\nFinally, the horizontal dashed line identifying E[U(X)] allows us to identify the certainty equivalent of the gamble. At the point on the x-axis marked CE, the utility from the certainty equivalent is equal to the expected utility of the prospect with expected value E[X]. As the certainty equivalent is less than the expected value, this provides another way of saying that the person is risk averse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrisk_aversion_plot_4 <- risk_aversion_plot_3+\n\n  #Add vertical line indicating certainty equivalent and labelled \"CE\"\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = ce, xend = ce, y = 0, yend = u(ce), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = ce, y = 0, label = \"CE\", size = 4, hjust = 0.4, vjust = 1.5)\n\nrisk_aversion_plot_4\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Risk aversion 4](expected-utility-theory_files/figure-html/fig-risk-aversion-4-1.png){#fig-risk-aversion-4 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### Absolute and relative risk aversion\n\nIn studying economics, you may encounter two measures of risk aversion: absolute risk aversion and relative risk aversion.\n\nAbsolute risk aversion is a measure of how risk averse a person is at any particular level of wealth. A person with constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) responds to a fixed sum bet in the same way, whatever their wealth.\n\nFor example, when faced with a 50-50 bet to win \\$20 or lose \\$10, they will make the same decision regardless of whether they have $100 or $1,000,000 in their bank account.\n\nRelative risk aversion is a measure of how an individual's risk aversion scales with their wealth. A person with constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) would respond to a bet risking a certain proportion of their wealth in the same way, whatever their wealth. This means that as their wealth increases, the absolute amount they're willing to risk increases, but it remains a constant proportion of their total wealth.\n\nFor example, someone with constant relative risk aversion would always respond in the same way to a 50-50 bet to win 50% of their wealth, lose 40% of their wealth, regardless of whether that loss involves a possible $400 out of \\$1,000 or \\$400,000 out of \\$1,000,000.\n\nConstant absolute risk aversion utility functions are often used in theoretical models due to their mathematical simplicity. However, constant relative risk aversion utility functions are generally considered more realistic for modelling human behaviour, as people tend to adjust their risk-taking based on their wealth.\n\nOne feature of constant relative risk aversion utility functions, such as log utility, is that people become less risk averse (as measured by absolute risk aversion) as their wealth increases. For a bet of a certain sum, they will be more likely to accept that bet at higher wealth.\n\nThis above plot is of a utility function with constant relative risk aversion. You can see that as the level of wealth increases, the utility function becomes increasingly linear. This reduction in curvature reflects the declining absolute risk aversion and results in bets of fixed value being more likely to be accepted at higher wealth.\n\n### Risk neutrality\n\nA risk-neutral person is an expected value maximiser. They are indifferent between \\$10 for certain and a gamble with an expected value of \\$10. The certainty equivalent of the prospect for a person considering this gamble would also be \\$10.\n\nThe following chart illustrates. Again, we have two possible outcomes, $x_1$ and $x_2$, with resulting utility $U(x_1)$ and $U(x_2)$.\n\nA line between the points on the utility curve for each of those outcomes lies on the utility curve itself. For any probability, the utility of the expected value and the expected utility are the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nu <- function(x){\n  x\n}\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x=seq(1,220,0.1),\n  y=NA\n)\n\ndf$y <- u(df$x)\n\n#Variables for plot (may not match labels as not done to scale)\n#Payoffs from gamble\np1 <- 0.5\nx1 <- 30 #loss\np2 <- 0.5\nx2 <- 200 #win\nev <- p1*x1+p2*x2 #expected value of gamble\nxc <-115 #certain outcome\nce <-p1*u(x1)+p2*u(x2) #certainty equivalent\npx2 <-(ev-x1)/(x2-x1)\n\nggplot(mapping = aes(x, y)) +\n\n  #Plot the utility curve\n  geom_line(data = df) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linewidth=0.25)+ \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth=0.25)+\n  labs(x = \"x\", y = \"U(x)\")+\n\n  # Set the theme\n  theme_minimal()+\n\n  #remove numbers on each axis\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n            axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n            axis.title=element_text(size=14,face=\"bold\"),\n            axis.title.y = element_text(angle=0, vjust=0.5))+\n\n  #set limits - need to include room for labels\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-40, 220), ylim = c(-0.25, 220))+\n\n  #Add labels x1, U(x1) and line to curve indicating each\n  annotate(\"text\", x = x1, y = 0, label = \"x1\", size = 4, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 1.5)+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = x1, y = 0, xend = x1, yend = u(x1), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 0, y = u(x1), xend = x1, yend = u(x1), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 0, y = u(x1), label = \"U(x1)\", size = 4, hjust = 1.05, vjust = 0.6)+\n\n  #Add line to curve indicating utility of expected value\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = xc, y = 0, xend = xc, yend = u(xc), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 0, y = u(xc), xend = xc, yend = u(xc), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 0, y = u(xc), label = \"U[E(X)]=E[U(X)]\", size = 4, hjust = 1.05, vjust = 0.3)+\n\n  #Add labels x2, U(x2) and line to curve indicating each\n  annotate(\"text\", x = x2, y = 0, label = \"x2\", size = 4, hjust = 0.4, vjust = 1.5)+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = x2, y = 0, xend = x2, yend = u(x2), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 0, y = u(x2), xend = x2, yend = u(x2), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 0, y = u(x2), label = \"U(x2)\", size = 4, hjust = 1.05, vjust = 0.45)+\n\n  #Add labels E[X], E[U(X)] and curve indicating each\n  annotate(\"text\", x = ev, y = 0, label = \"E[X]=CE\", size = 4, hjust = 0.4, vjust = 1.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Risk neutral](expected-utility-theory_files/figure-html/fig-risk-neutral-1.png){#fig-risk-neutral width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Risk seeking\n\nA risk-seeking person prefers a gamble to a sure sum equal to the expected value of that gamble.

That is, for any probabilities involving those two outcomes (except one of those outcomes with certainty), the expected utility of the prospect is more than the utility of the expected value of the prospect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nu <- function(x){\n  x^1.5\n}\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  x=seq(1,220,0.1),\n  y=NA\n)\n\ndf$y <- u(df$x)\n\n#Variables for plot (may not match labels as not done to scale)\n#Payoffs from gamble\np1 <- 0.5\nx1 <- 30 #loss\np2 <- 0.5\nx2 <- 200 #win\nev <- p1*x1+p2*x2 #expected value of gamble\nxc <-115 #certain outcome\nce <-(p1*u(x1)+p2*u(x2))^(1/1.5) #certainty equivalent\npx2 <-(ev-x1)/(x2-x1)\n\nggplot(mapping = aes(x, y)) +\n\n  #Plot the utility curve\n  geom_line(data = df) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linewidth=0.25)+ \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth=0.25)+\n  labs(x = \"x\", y = \"U(x)\")+\n\n  # Set the theme\n  theme_minimal()+\n\n  #remove numbers on each axis\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n            axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n            axis.title=element_text(size=14,face=\"bold\"),\n            axis.title.y = element_text(angle=0, vjust=0.5))+\n\n  #set limits - need to include room for labels\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-25, 220), ylim = c(-0.25, 3000))+\n\n  #Add labels x1, U(x1) and line to curve indicating each\n  annotate(\"text\", x = x1, y = 0, label = \"x1\", size = 4, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 1.5)+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = x1, y = 0, xend = x1, yend = u(x1), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 0, y = u(x1), xend = x1, yend = u(x1), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 0, y = u(x1), label = \"U(x1)\", size = 4, hjust = 1.05, vjust = 0.6)+\n\n  #Add line to curve indicating utility of expected value\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = xc, y = 0, xend = xc, yend = u(xc), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 0, y = u(xc), xend = xc, yend = u(xc), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 0, y = u(xc), label = \"U[E(X)]\", size = 4, hjust = 1.05, vjust = 0.3)+\n\n  #Add expected utility line\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = x1, xend = x2, y = u(x1), yend = u(x2), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotdash\")+\n\n  #Add labels x2, U(x2) and line to curve indicating each\n  annotate(\"text\", x = x2, y = 0, label = \"x2\", size = 4, hjust = 0.4, vjust = 1.5)+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = x2, y = 0, xend = x2, yend = u(x2), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 0, y = u(x2), xend = x2, yend = u(x2), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 0, y = u(x2), label = \"U(x2)\", size = 4, hjust = 1.05, vjust = 0.45)+\n\n  #Add labels E[X], E[U(X)] and curve indicating each\n  annotate(\"text\", x = ev, y = 0, label = \"E[X]\", size = 4, hjust = 0.4, vjust = 1.5)+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = ev, y = 0, xend = ev, yend = u(x1)+(u(x2)-u(x1))*px2, linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dashed\")+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 0, y = u(x1)+(u(x2)-u(x1))*px2, xend = ev, yend = u(x1)+(u(x2)-u(x1))*px2, linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dashed\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 0, y = u(x1)+(u(x2)-u(x1))*px2, label = \"E[U(X)]\", size = 4, hjust = 1.05, vjust = 0.45)+\n\n  #Add vertical line indicating certainty equivalent and labelled \"CE\" plus line extending to utility curve\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = ce, xend = ce, y = 0, yend = u(ce), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = ce, y = 0, label = \"CE\", size = 4, hjust = 0.4, vjust = 1.5)+\n  annotate(\"segment\", x = 0, y = u(ce), xend = ce, yend = u(ce), linewidth = 0.5, colour = \"black\", linetype=\"dotted\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Risk seeking](expected-utility-theory_files/figure-html/fig-risk-seeking-1.png){#fig-risk-seeking width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe expected utility line between the two outcomes is always above the utility curve as the curve is convex.
