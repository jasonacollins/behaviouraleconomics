# Behavioural Economics Notes

This project contains the source files for the UTS undergraduate subject [23005 Behavioural Economics](https://handbook.uts.edu.au/subjects/23005.html).

These notes are written using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). To render these notes, you will need to have Quarto installed. You can find installation instructions on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

Once Quarto is installed, you can render the entire project (which is configured as a Quarto website) by navigating to the project's root directory in your terminal and running:

```bash
quarto render
```

This command will process the `.qmd` files and generate the outputinto a `_book` directory.

To preview the website locally as you make changes, you can use:

```bash
quarto preview
```

This will render the site and open it in your web browser, automatically refreshing when you save changes to the source files.

## Deployment

The configuration for the website, including deployment details (such as the target website URL), can be found in the `_quarto.yml` file in the root of this project.
