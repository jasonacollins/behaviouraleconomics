The set of decisions across Choice 1 and Choice 2 are time consistent. If the agent selected \\$110 in two weeks for Choice 2 and was given a chance to change their choice after one week (which is effectively Choice 1), they would not change.\n\n## Example 2\n\nSuppose we have an exponential discounter with $\\delta=0.95$ per week and utility each period of $u(x_n)=x_n$\n\nThey are offered \\$100 today. What sum would they need to be offered in one year (52 weeks) to prefer that later payment to the \\$100 today?\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(0,\\$100)&=u(\\$100) \\\\\n&=100\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\begin{align*}\nU_0(52,\\$x)&=\\delta^{52} u(\\$x) \\\\\n&=0.95^{52}*x\n\\end{align*}\n\nThey will prefer \\$$x$ in 52 weeks if $U(\\$x \\text{ at } t=52)$ is greater than 100.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n0.95^{52}*x&>100 \\\\[6pt]\nx&>\\frac{100}{0.95^{52}} \\\\[6pt]\nx&>\\$1440.03\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe agent would be willing to wait a year for payment if they were paid more than $1440.03.\n",
