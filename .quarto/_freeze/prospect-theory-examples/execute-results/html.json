Consumers are willing to buy insurance with a negative expected value as the consumer prefers the certainty of the premium payment to the risk of suffering an uninsured loss. (The negative expected value is due to the insurer's profit and administrative costs.)\n\nProspect theory provides an alternative explanation. The purchase of insurance involves a certain loss (the premium) or a gamble involving the possibility of either a large loss or the status quo. As prospect theory has people as risk seeking in the loss domain, we would not expect them to purchase insurance.\n\nHowever, under prospect theory people also overweight small probabilities. This overweighting of small probabilities can make the purchase of insurance attractive even though it is in the loss domain. This combination of the loss domain but small probabilities is the bottom-right quadrant of the fourfold pattern to risk attitudes generated by prospect theory.\n\nThe following numerical example is an illustration.\n\nAn agent is considering insurance against bushfire for its \\$1,000,000 house. The house has a 1 in 1000 chance of burning down. An insurer is willing to offer full coverage for \\$1100. (Note: \\$1000 is the actuarially fair price, the additional \\$100 might represent profit or administrative costs.)\n\nWould an expected value maximiser or risk neutral person purchase the insurance?\n\n\n$$E[\\text{purchase}]=-\\text{premium}=-\\$1,100$$\n\n\nThe expected value of purchasing insurance is the guaranteed loss of the premium.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nE[\\text{don't}]&=P_{\\text{burn}}*-value_{\\text{house}} \\\\\n&=-0.001*1000000 \\\\\n&=-\\$1000\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe expected value of purchasing insurance is \\$100 less than the expected value of risking the house burning down. A risk neutral agent (who maximises expected value) would not purchase this insurance.\n\nWould a risk averse agent purchase the insurance? Suppose they have a logarithmic utility function ($U(x)=ln(x)$) and they have \\$10,000 in cash in addition to their house, giving them wealth ($W$) of \\$1,010,000.\n\n\\begin{align*}\nE[U(\\text{purchase})]&=ln(W-premium) \\\\\n&=ln(1,008,900) \\\\\n&=13.8244 \\\\\n\\\\\nE[U(\\text{don't})]&=0.999*ln(W)+0.001*ln(W-value_{\\text{house}}) \\\\\n&=0.999*ln(1,010,000)+0.001*ln(10,000) \\\\\n&=13.8208\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe expected utility of purchasing insurance is greater than the expected utility from not purchasing insurance. This agent will insure against the fire despite it being actuarially unfair.\n\nConsider an agent who is risk seeking in the domain of losses but weights probability linearly. Their value function is:\n\n\n$$\nv(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\nx^{0.8} \\qquad &\\textrm{where} \\space x \\geq 0\\\\\n-2(-x)^{0.8} \\quad &\\textrm{where} \\space x < 0 \n\\end{matrix}\\right.\n$$\n\n\nWhere $x$ is the realised outcome relative to the reference point.\n\nDetermination of the reference point can be arbitrary. What if you pay insurance every year? Could the reference point then be wealth minus the insurance payment (meaning the insurance payment is in the gain domain)?\n\nTaking the reference point as current wealth, would this agent purchase the insurance?\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV(purchase)&=v(-1,100) \\\\\n&=-(1,100)^{0.8} \\\\\n&=-271.1 \\\\\n\\\\\nV(don't)&=0.999*(0)+0.001*v(-1,000,000) \\\\\n&=0.999*0-0.001*(1,000,000)^{0.8} \\\\\n&=-63.1\n\\end{align*}\n\nAs $V(purchase)<V(don't)$, the agent does not purchase insurance. The diminishing feeling of loss leads to them weigh the certain loss of the premium relatively more heavily than the chance of losing the value of their house.\n\nIncluding loss aversion in the value function does not change the decision as all possible outcomes are in the loss domain.\n\nWould a person who is risk seeking in the domain of losses (i.e. the value function with reflection effect above) and applies the decision weights described below purchase the insurance?\n\nThey apply decision weights as per the following table:\n\n|                |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n|  **Probability**   |   0.001  |   0.01  | 0.1 |0.25   |  0.5   |  0.75   |  0.9   | 0.99    |  0.999   |\n|   **Weight**       |  0.01   |  0.05   |   0.15  |  0.3   |  0.5   |  0.7   | 0.85    |  0.95   |  0.99   |\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV(purchase)&=v(-1,100) \\\\\n&=-(1,100)^{0.8} \\\\\n&=-271 \\\\\n\\\\\nV(don't)&=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\pi(p_i)v(x_i) \\\\\n&=\\pi(0.999)*v(0)+\\pi(0.001)*v(-1,000,000) \\\\\n&=0.99*0-0.01*(1,000,000)^{0.8} \\\\\n&=-631\n\\end{align*}\n\nAlthough the diminishing feeling of loss leads to them weigh the certain loss of the premium relatively more heavily than the chance of losing the value of their house, the overweighting of the probability of fire leads them to purchase insurance. Again, if we had included loss aversion it would not have changed the decision as all possible outcomes are in the loss domain.\n\n## A gamble\n\nSuppose an agent has the following reference-dependent utility function:\n\n\n$$\nv(x)=\\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\nx^{1/2} \\qquad &\\textrm{where} \\space x \\geq 0\\\\\n-2(-x)^{1/2} \\quad &\\textrm{where} \\space x < 0 \n\\end{matrix}\\right.\n$$\n\n\nWhere $x$ is the realised outcome relative to the reference point.\n\nAssume that the agent’s reference point is the status quo and the agent is offered the gamble A:\n\n\n$$(\\$110, 0.5; −\\$100, 0.5)$$\n\n\n**Question 1**\n\nWill they want to play this gamble?\n\nThe utility from the gamble is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV(A)&=0.5*v(110)-0.5*v(-100) \\\\\n&=0.5*(110)^{0.5}-0.5*2*(100)^{0.5} \\\\\n&=-4.76\n\\end{align*}\n\nThey will not want to play this gamble as it has a negative value for the agent. They could receive value of 0 by simply not playing.\n\nThe reason for this negative value is that the agent is loss averse. The loss of \\$100 is given twice the weight of an equivalent gain.\n\n**Question 2**\n\nSuppose the agent loses their wallet containing \\$100. They feel bad about it and perceive it as a loss. Their reference point is unchanged at the original status quo, but the amount of money they have any after any outcome is \\$100 less than otherwise. Would they be willing to take gamble A now?\n\nAfter losing \\$100 but not changing their reference point, they have two possible outcomes relative to their reference point: a gain of \\$10 (winning \\$110 minus the lost money in the wallet) and a loss of \\$200 (losing \\$100 and also losing their wallet).\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV(A)&=0.5*v(-100+110)-0.5*v(-100-100) \\\\\n&=0.5*(10)^{0.5}-0.5*2*(200)^{0.5} \\\\\n&=-12.56\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe utility of not playing the gamble involves remaining with a loss of \\$100:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV(\\neg A)&=v(-100) \\\\\n&=-2*(100)^{0.5} \\\\\n&=-20\n\\end{align*}\n\nThey will now want to play the gamble as it has a greater value than staying with their current loss. The reason the gamble becomes attractive is because it gives an opportunity to recover the loss. The agent is risk seeking over the loss domain. (They would even accept a 50:50 gamble to win \\$100, lose \\$100 with an expected value of zero.)\n\n**Question 3**\n\nThe agent has now adapted to their loss of \\$100. The new reference point is the new wealth level incorporating the loss wallet. Would they take gamble A now?\n\nWe are now back to an identical situation as in Question 1. They will not want to partake in the gamble.\n\n**Question 4**\n\nThe agent wins \\$10,000 at the casino. They feel good about their win, so their reference point remains at their wealth excluding the win. Would they take gamble A now?\n\nWith the additional \\$10,000, the value from the gamble is now:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV(A)&=0.5*v(10000+110)+0.5*v(10000-100) \\\\[6pt]\n&=0.5*(10110)^{0.5}+0.5*(9900)^{0.5} \\\\[6pt]\n&=100.02\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe value of not playing the gamble is:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nV(\\neg A)&=v(10000) \\\\[6pt]\n&=(10000)^{0.5} \\\\[6pt]\n&=100\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe gamble is now attractive. They are less risk averse at a higher wealth, and the gamble is entirely in the gain domain, meaning that loss aversion does not affect the decision.\n",
