If they were offered the gamble for free, their expected utility would be:\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\nEU(x)&=0.5(1000+550)^{1/2}+0.5(1000-500)^{1/2} \\\\[6pt]\n&=30.86\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n\nThis is less than if they simply turned down the gamble. They would be willing to pay to avoid the gamble. How much?\n\nWe can determine this by asking what wealth a utility of 30.86 is:\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\nW^{1/2}&=30.86 \\\\[6pt]\nW&=30.51^2 \\\\[6pt]\n&=\\$952.67\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n\nThe certainty equivalent of the gamble is \\$952.67.

Explain.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Question 4(c) answer\n\nIf they now have \\$1 million in wealth, we simply repeat the calculations above with the new wealth.\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\nEU(x)&=0.5(1000000+550-20)^{1/2}+0.5(1000000-500-20)^{1/2} \\\\[6pt]\n&=1000.00247\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n\n\nThe expected utility of not playing the gamble is:\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\nEU(x)&=(1000000)^{1/2} \\\\[6pt]\n&=1000\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n\nThey would be willing to pay \\$20 as they would have higher utility if they accepted the gamble.\n\nWhat is the most they would be willing to pay? If they were offered the gamble for free, their expected utility would be:\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\nEU(x)&=0.5(1000000+550)^{1/2}+0.5(1000000-500)^{1/2} \\\\[6pt]\n&=1000.0125\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n\nHow much would they be willing to pay for this opportunity? We can determine this by asking what wealth a utility of 1000.0125 is:\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\nW&=(1000.0124655)^2 \\\\[6pt]\n&=\\$1000024.93\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\n\nThe agent would be willing to pay up to \\$24.93 for the gamble. This is close to the expected value of \\$25.\n\nIntuitively, as the agent's wealth increases their utility function becomes increasingly linear (second derivative approaches zero) and they become closer to risk neutral.\n:::\n\n## Question 5: Expected utility: insurance\n\nAn agent is considering insurance against bushfire for its \\$1,000,000 house. The house has a 1 in 1000 chance of burning down. An insurer is willing to offer full coverage for \\$1100.\n\na\\) Would a risk neutral agent purchase the insurance?\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Question 5a) answer\nWe have already calculated that purchasing insurance in this case has a lower expected value than not purchasing the insurance. A risk neutral agent would not purchase the insurance.\n:::\n\nb\\) Suppose an agent has a logarithmic utility function ($U(x)=ln(x)$) and they have \\$10,000 in cash in addition to their house, giving them wealth ($W$) of \\$1,010,000. Would this agent purchase the insurance? Are they risk seeking, risk neutral or risk averse?\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Question 5b) answer\n\\begin{align*}\nE[U(\\text{purchase})]&=ln(W-premium) \\\\\n&=ln(1,008,900) \\\\\n&=13.8244\\\\\n\\\\\nE[U(\\text{don't})]&=0.999*ln(W)+0.001*ln(W-value_{\\text{house}}) \\\\\n&=0.999*ln(1,010,000)+0.001*ln(10,000) \\\\\n&=13.8208\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe expected utility of purchasing insurance is greater than the expected utility from not purchasing insurance. This agent will purchase insurance. They are risk averse.\n\nWhat is the intuition for this agent's purchase of insurance? Diminishing marginal utility means that the utility of average wealth is greater than the average utility of wealth (e.g. $U(\\$0)+U(\\$200)<U(\\$100)+U(\\$100)$). Therefore, their expected utility is higher when wealth is distributed evenly across the possible states of the world rather than concentrated in one state - or in the case of a disaster, very low in one state. The consumer insures as a way of evenly distributing wealth across all possible states.\n:::\n\n## Question 6: An anomaly in expected utility\n\nConsider the following two choices:\n\n**Choice 1**: Choose one of the following bets:\n\nBet A:\n\n-   \\$10,000 with probability: 11%\n-   \\$0 with probability: 89%\n\nBet B:\n\n-   \\$50,000 with probability: 10%\n-   \\$0 with probability: 90%\n\n**Choice 2**: Choose one of the following bets:\n\nBet A':\n\n-   \\$10,000 with probability: 100%\n\nBet B':\n\n-   \\$50,000 with probability: 10%\n-   \\$10,000 with probability: 89%\n-   \\$0 with probability: 1%\n\nMany people pick B for Choice 1 and A' for Choice 2.\n\nDoes this pair of choices conform with Expected Utility Theory? Why?\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Question 6 answer\nAccording to Expected Utility Theory, if an agent selects B:\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\n0.10U(50,000)+0.90U(0)&> 0.11U(10,000)+ 0.89U(0) \\\\[6pt]\n0.10U(50,000)+0.01U(0)&> 0.11U(10,000)\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\nAccording to Expected Utility Theory, if an agent selects A':\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{align*}\nU(10,000)&>0.10U(50,000)+0.89U(10,000)+0.01U(0) \\\\[6pt]\n0.11U(10,000)&>0.89U(50,000)+0.01U(0)\n\\end{align*}\n```\n\nThis is a contradiction. Under expected utility theory, if an agent chooses B it should choose B'. And if the agent chooses A it should choose A'.\n\nThis occurs due to a breach in the principle of independence.\n\nHere is a representation of the choices.\n\n![](img/allais-paradox-4.jpg)\n\nThe bets in the two shaded areas are the same. They are paired with an outcomes of either \\$10,000 or \\$0. Preferring B to A and A' to B' is a violation of the axiom of the [independence of irrelevant alternatives](@sec-independence): Under that axiom, two gambles mixed with an irrelevant third gamble will maintain the same order of preference as when the two are presented independently of the third gamble.\n\nUsing this representation in the table, here is another way of understanding why this combination of choices is an anomaly. Imagine there are 100 tickets numbered 1 to 100. One ticket will be drawn. If a ticket between 1 and 89 is drawn, you win the prize in the first column. If a ticket between 90 and 99 is drawn, you win the amount in the second. If a 100 is drawn, you win the sum in the third.\n\nSuppose that you know the ticket that is drawn is between 1 and 89. Would you prefer A or B? As you would win \\$0 with either choice, you will be indifferent. You will similarly be indifferent between A' and B', winning \\$10,00 no matter what.\n\nSuppose instead that a ticket between 90 and 100 is drawn, but you know which. You can see that if you prefer A to B, you should also prefer A' to B'. In each choice you are effectively facing the same bet. Let's assume for the moment that you prefer B and B'.\n\nFinally, suppose you don't know what ticket will be drawn. We have just determined that if you know the ticket is between 1 and 89 you are indifferent between the options, but if between 90 and 100 is drawn you prefer B and B'. You do not prefer A or A' when the ticket range is 1 to 89 or 90 to 100, so you should not prefer A or A' when the ticket number is unknown.\n\nFinally, using the formal definition for the independence of irrelevant alternatives axiom:\n\n-   if $x$ and $y$ are lotteries with $x\\succcurlyeq y$ and\n-   $p$ is the probability that a third option $z$ is present, then: $$\n    pz+(1-p)x\\succcurlyeq pz+(1-p)y\n    $$\n\nFor each of the choices in our lottery:\n\n-   $p=89\\%$\n\n-   $x$ is a 100% chance of \\$10,000\n\n-   $y$ is a 0.01/(1-0.89) chance of \\$0 and 0.10/(1-0.89) chance of \\$50,000\n\n-   $z$ is \\$10,000 in choice 1 and \\$0 in choice 2, although $z$'s value does not matter due to its assumed irrelevance.\n:::\n",
